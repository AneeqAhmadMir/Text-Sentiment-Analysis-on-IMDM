Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Reviews Dataset
 I worked on a sentiment analysis project using the IMDB reviews dataset. My goal was to build a model that could accurately predict whether a movie review was positive or negative. Below is a detailed description of the tasks I performed and the outcomes I achieved.

1. Text Preprocessing
The first step I undertook was preparing the raw text data for analysis.
Tokenized the reviews, breaking them down into individual words to make the text easier to analyze.
Removed stopwords such as “the,” “is,” and “and,” which do not add meaningful information for sentiment classification.
Applied lemmatization to convert words to their base form (for example, “running” to “run”), which helped in normalizing the text and reducing redundancy.

2. Feature Engineering
After preprocessing, I transformed the cleaned text into numerical data that machine learning models can understand. I used:
TF-IDF vectorization to convert the text into weighted features based on the importance of words in each review relative to the entire dataset.
This step was crucial because it allowed the model to focus on words that are more relevant for determining sentiment.

4. Model Training
Next, I trained classification models to predict the sentiment of the reviews. Specifically, I:
Implemented Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes classifiers.
Trained these models using the numerical features extracted from the text.
Compared their performances to select the best model for the task.

4. Model Evaluation
To ensure the model was reliable and accurate, I evaluated its performance using:
Precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
These metrics helped me understand the model’s ability to correctly identify positive and negative sentiments, balancing between false positives and false negatives.

Outcome
By the end of this project, I developed a fully functional Python script that:

Takes raw text input.
Processes and transforms it through the preprocessing and feature engineering steps.
Predicts the sentiment of the input review.
Provides detailed evaluation metrics to assess the model’s performance.
